# Module 1 Challenge: LendingTree Case Study

## Overview and Origin
* **Company name:** LendingTree.
* Lending Tree was incorporated on June 7, 1996 in Delaware. Nationwide operations were later launched on July 1, 1998. LendingTree headquarters is now located in Charlotte, North Carolina.
* **Founder:** Douglas Lebda (CEO).
* The idea for LendingTree dawned on Doug Lebda when he first experienced his own problems and frustrations applying for a mortgage. He envisioned a simplified way to shop for loans - instead of visiting various banks in person, the customer could easily and conveniently access this information online - leading to the development of LendingTree.
* LendingTree has had 3 successful funding rounds. In its latest funding round (post IPO), LendingTree raised $500M (July 21, 2020). In previous rounds, Lending Tree raised $350M in Oct 2018 and $300M in Dec 2017. Total funding raised to date equates to $1.15 billion.
