# Module 1 Challenge: LendingTree Case Study

## Overview and Origin

### LendingTree Inc.



LendingTree was incorporated on June 7, 1996 in Delaware. Nationwide operations were later launched on July 1, 1998. LendingTree headquarters is now located in Charlotte, North Carolina.

**Founder:** Douglas Lebda (CEO).

The idea for LendingTree dawned on Doug Lebda when he first experienced his own problems and frustrations applying for a mortgage. He envisioned a simplified way to shop for loans. Instead of visiting various banks in person, the customer could easily and conveniently access this information online - leading to the development of LendingTree.

LendingTree has had 3 successful funding rounds. In it's latest funding round (post IPO), LendingTree raised $500M (July 21, 2020). In the previous 2 rounds, LendingTree raised $350M in Oct 2018 and $300M in Dec 2017. Total funding raised to date equates to $1.15 billion.

2. Loan approval rate
3. Application approval rate

Most competitors have experienced a revenue decrease in the last quarter, as noted by [CSI Market](https://csimarket.com/stocks/compet_glance.php?code=TREE) "LendingTree Inc. reported revenue decrease in the 3rd quarter 2023 year on year by -34.75 %, faster than the overall decrease of LendingTree Inc.'s competitors by -2.53 %, recorded in the same quarter."

## Recommendations

An opportunity for growth within LendingTree includes enhancing their insurance comparison and purchasing function. While LendingTree already offers some insurance products, it could expand its insurance services to include a broader range of coverage types. This might involve allowing users to compare and purchase various insurance policies, such as life insurance, health insurance, property insurance, travel insurance, or liability insurance. 

Offering a wider array of insurance products can diversify revenue streams, increase cross-selling opportunities, and allow for bundled products - further giving the company a competitive advantage. 

LendingTree likely already uses many of the required technoliges needed to diversify their insurance product offerings. These include technologies such as HTML and Javascript, SQL, cloud services, AI and Machine Learning, APIs, and data analytics such as Google Analytics.

These techonologies are necessary for the development of webpages and mobile apps, cloud services to host and scale applications and data, and AI for risk assessment and personalized recommendations for the user.
